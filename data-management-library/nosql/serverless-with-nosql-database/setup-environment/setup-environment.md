# Prepare Your Environment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps necessary to create a proper operating environment.  

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Create a compartment
* Create API Key and Authorization tokens
* Learn about Credentials, and Policies

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, or Paid Account


## Task 1: Create a Compartment

1. Log into the OCI console using your tenancy.  Please make note of what region you are at.

    ![](images/console-image.png)

2. On left side drop down (left of Oracle Cloud banner), go to Identity & Security and then Compartments.

    ![](images/identity-security-compartment.png)

3. Click on Create Compartment. This opens up a new window.

  Enter **demonosql** as compartment name, enter a description and hit 'Create Compartment' button at bottom of window.  The parent compartment will display your current parent compartment -- this does not need to be changed.  You can change your parent if you want to be under a different parent compartment.

## Task 2: Create an API Key and Auth Token For Your User

1. Top right, click on your Profile -> User Settings.

  ![](images/user-profile.png)

2. Click 'User Settings' again. Copy your OCID.   **Make sure to save your OCID for future steps**. Paste it into notepad, some text file, etc. as it will be used in Step 4.

3. Open the Cloud Shell in the top right menu.  It can take about 2 minutes to get the Cloud Shell started.  

    ![](images/cloud-shell.png)

  **Note:** This needs to be executed in the **HOME region**.  Please ensure you are in your home region.  The Cloud Shell prompt shows you what region the shell is running out of.

4. Execute these commands in your Cloud Shell.  Replace "YOURUSEROCID" with your OCID you copied above **before** executing.

    ````
    <copy>
    openssl genrsa -out NoSQLLabPrivateKey.pem  4096        
    openssl rsa -pubout -in NoSQLLabPrivateKey.pem -out NoSQLLabPublicKey.pem
    oci iam user api-key upload --user-id YOURUSEROCID --key-file NoSQLLabPublicKey.pem > info.json
    </copy>
    ````
    If you execute the 'oci iam' command before replacing "YOURUSEROCID" then you will get the following error:
    **"Authorization failed or requested resource not found".**   Replace "YOURUSEROCID" and try the last command again.  

    If you execute the 'oci iam' command and you get this error "ApiKeyLimitExceeded" then you need to delete some keys you already created.  Go to your user details screen, and API Keys to find old keys to delete.
        
5. Exit Cloud Shell  

## Task 3: Understand Credentials, and Policies

**Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management to provide secure access to Oracle Cloud.** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management enables you to create user accounts and give users permission to inspect, read, use, or manage tables.  Credentials are used for connecting your application to the service and are associated with a specific user.  The credentials consist of the tenancy ID, the user ID, an API signing key, a fingerprint and optionally a passphrase for the signing key.   These got created in Task 2 of this lab and are stored in the info.json file in your Cloud Shell.

The Oracle NoSQL Database SDKs allow you to provide the credentials to an application in multiple ways.  The SDKs support a configuration file as well as one or more interfaces that allow direct specification of the information. You can use the SignatureProvider API to supply your credentials to NoSQL Database.  Oracle NoSQL has SDKs in the following languages:  Java, Node.js, Python, Go, Spring and C#.

In this node.js snippet, we used the credential information created in Task 2 and specified the credentials directly as part of auth.iam property in the initial configuration.  The tenancy ID, the user ID, an API signing key, a fingerprint are all supplied.   The tenancy iD and the user ID are referred to as OCIDs.

````
       return new NoSQLClient({
            region: Region.EU_FRANKFURT_1,
			compartment:'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaamg....y3hsyi57paa',
            auth: {
                iam: {
                    tenantId: 'ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaahrs4avamaxisc...........slpsdb2d2xe2kp2q',
                    userId: 'ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaaq.......co3ssybmexcu4ba',
                    fingerprint: 'e1:4f:7f:e7:b5:7c:11:38:ed:e5:9f:6d:92:bb:ae:3d',
                    privateKeyFile: 'NoSQLprivateKey.pem'
                }
            }
        });
````

  Another way to handle authentication is with Instance and Resource Principals.   The Oracle NoSQL SDKs support both of them.  Resource principals are tied to functions.    We are not using functions in this workshop so we will not discuss those any further.

  Instance Principals is a capability in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) that lets you make service calls from an instance. With instance principals, you donâ€™t need to configure user credentials or rotate the credentials. Instances themselves are a principal type in IAM and are set up in IAM.  You can think of them as an IAM service feature that enables instances to be authorized actors (or principals) to perform actions on service resources.  Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud service has three different resource types, namely, nosql-tables, nosql-rows, and nosql-indexes.  It also has one aggregate resource called nosql-family.  

  Policies are created that allow a group to work in certain ways with specific types of resources such as NoSQL Tables in a particular compartment.  All NoSQL Tables belong to a defined compartment.  In Task 1 of this Lab, we created the demonosql compartment and this is where we will create our tables.  

  You can use **Resource Principals** to do the connection to NoSQL Cloud Service as shown below in the Node.js and Python examples instead of specifying the credentials.  Once they are set up, they are very simple use because all you need to do is call the appropriate authorization constructor.

In this snippet, there are hard-coded references (eg REGION).

**NoSQL Database Node.js SDK**
```
function createClientResource() {
  return  new NoSQLClient({
    region: Region.EU_FRANKFURT_1,
    compartment:'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaafml3tc......jimgx3cdnirgup6rhptxwnandq',
    auth: {
        iam: {
            useResourcePrincipal: true
        }
    }
  });
}
```
**NoSQL Database Python SDK**
```
def get_handle():
     provider = borneo.iam.SignatureProvider.create_with_resource_principal()
     config = borneo.NoSQLHandleConfig('eu-frankfurt-1', provider).set_logger(None)
     return borneo.NoSQLHandle(config)
```
In the next labs we are going to be running application code and we need an instance to run that from.   In Task 2 we started the Cloud Shell which is the instance where we will run the application.   Currently, Cloud Shell does not support Instance Principals so in those labs we are using credentials.

## Task 4: Move to Phoenix

Oracle NoSQL Always Free tables are available only in the Phoenix region.  If Phoenix is **not** your home region then we need to move there.  Skip this Task if Phoenix is your home region.

1.  Check to see if Phoenix shows up in your region drop down list.  Click the down arrow by the region.

    ![](images/no-phoenix.png)

2.  If it is there, click on it and move your tenancy to Phoenix and **proceed to the next lab.**

    ![](images/phoenix.png)

3.  Since it is not there, please subscribe to Phoenix Region.  Click on drop down by your region and click on 'Manage Regions'.

    ![](images/manage-regions.png)

4.  This will bring up a list of regions.  Look for Phoenix and hit 'Subscribe'.

    ![](images/capturesuscribe.png)

5. If you havent been moved to Phoenix, then click on Phoenix to move your tenancy.

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
