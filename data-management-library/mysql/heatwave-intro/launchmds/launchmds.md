## Task 4: Connect to MySQL Database - HeatWave

HeatWave is an add-on to MySQL Database Service. It provides a highly performant and scalable in-memory analytic processing engine optimized for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Customers can run HeatWave on data stored in the MySQL database without requiring ETL and without any change to the application. Applications simply access HeatWave via standard MySQL protocols, and the typical administration actions are automated, integrated and accessible via the OCI Web Console, REST API, CLI, or DevOps tools. HeatWave queries achieve orders of magnitude acceleration over the MySQL database.

1. Linux ad Mac users  use Terminal 

   Windows 10 users use Powershell


2.  From a terminal or powershell window on your local system. Connect to the Compute Instance with the SSH command. 

    Indicate the location of the private key you created earlier with **MDS-Client**. 
    
    Enter the username **opc** and the Public **IP Address**.

    Note: The **MDS-Client**  shows the  Public IP Address as mentioned on TASK 5: #11
    
    (Example: **ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@132.145.170...**) 


    ```
    <copy>ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@<your_compute_instance_ip></copy>
    ```


    ![Connect](./images/06connect01.png " ")

    **Install MySQL Shell on the Compute Instance**

3. You will need a MySQL client tool to connect to your new MySQL DB System from your client machine.

    Install MySQL Shell with the following command (enter y for each question)

    **[opc@…]$**

     ```
    <copy>sudo yum install –y mysql-shell</copy>
    ```
    ![Connect](./images/06connect02.png " ")

   **Connect to MySQL Database Service**

4. From your Compute instance, connect to MDS-HW MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool. 
   
   The endpoint (IP Address) can be found in the MDS-HW MySQL DB System Details page, under the "Endpoint" "Private IP Address". 

    ![Connect](./images/06connect03.png " ")

5.  Use the following command to connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool. Be sure to add the MDS-HW private IP address at the end of the cammand. Also enter the admin user password

    (Example  **mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h10.0.1..**)

 **[opc@...]$**

    ```
    <copy>mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h 10.0.1....</copy>
    ```
    ![Connect](./images/06connect04.png " ")

6. On MySQL Shell, switch to SQL mode  to try out some SQL commands 

 Enter the following command at the prompt:
     ```
    <copy>\SQL</copy>
    ```
 To display a list of databases, Enter the following command at the prompt:
      ```
    <copy>SHOW DATABASES;</copy>
    ```  
     
 To display the database version, current_date, and user enter the following command at the prompt:
      ```
    <copy>SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE, USER();</copy>
    ```  
 To display MysQL user and host from user table enter the following command at the prompt:
       ```
    <copy>SELECT USER, HOST FROM mysql.user;</copy>
      ```

    ```
    ![Connect](./images/12hwqueries01.png " ")

 5. Turn on `use_secondary_engine` variable to use HeatWave
     ```
    <copy>SET SESSION use_secondary_engine=ON;</copy>
    ```
    
6. Query a - Find per-company average age of passengers from Switzerland, Italy and France

 7. Before Runing a query, use EXPLAIN to verify that the query can be offloaded to the HeatWave cluster. For example:

    ```
    <copy>EXPLAIN SELECT
    airline.airlinename,
    AVG(datediff(departure,birthdate)/365.25) as avg_age,
    count(*) as nb_people
FROM
    booking, flight, airline, passengerdetails
WHERE
    booking.flight_id=flight.flight_id AND
    airline.airline_id=flight.airline_id AND
    booking.passenger_id=passengerdetails.passenger_id AND
    country IN ("SWITZERLAND", "FRANCE", "ITALY")
GROUP BY
    airline.airlinename
ORDER BY
    airline.airlinename, avg_age
LIMIT 10;</copy>
    ```
    ![Connect](./images/12hwqueries02.png " ")

8. After verifying that the query can be offloaded, run the query and note the execution time. Enter the following command at the prompt:
     ```
    <copy>SELECT
    airline.airlinename,
    AVG(datediff(departure,birthdate)/365.25) as avg_age,
    count(*) as nb_people
FROM
    booking, flight, airline, passengerdetails
WHERE
    booking.flight_id=flight.flight_id AND
    airline.airline_id=flight.airline_id AND
    booking.passenger_id=passengerdetails.passenger_id AND
    country IN ("SWITZERLAND", "FRANCE", "ITALY")
GROUP BY
    airline.airlinename
ORDER BY
    airline.airlinename, avg_age
LIMIT 10;
</copy>
    ```
     ![Connect](./images/12hwqueries03.png " ")

 9. To compare the HeatWave execution time with MySQL DB System execution time, disable the `use_secondary_engine` variable to see how long it takes to run the same query on the MySQL DB System. For example:

 Enter the following command at the prompt:
     ```
    <copy>SET SESSION use_secondary_engine=OFF;</copy>
    ```

 10. Enter the following command at the prompt:
     ```
    <copy>SELECT
    airline.airlinename,
    AVG(datediff(departure,birthdate)/365.25) as avg_age,
    count(*) as nb_people
FROM
    booking, flight, airline, passengerdetails
WHERE
    booking.flight_id=flight.flight_id AND
    airline.airline_id=flight.airline_id AND
    booking.passenger_id=passengerdetails.passenger_id AND
    country IN ("SWITZERLAND", "FRANCE", "ITALY")
GROUP BY
    airline.airlinename
ORDER BY
    airline.airlinename, avg_age
LIMIT 10;</copy>
    ```

 11. To see if `use_secondary_engine` is enabled (=ON)

 Enter the following command at the prompt:
     ```
    <copy>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'use_secondary_engine%';</copy>
    ```
 12. Runing additional queries. Remember to turn on and off the `use_secondary_engine`  to compare the execution time. 
   
    (Example  **SET SESSION `use_secondary_engine`=On;**) 

    (Example  **SET SESSION `use_secondary_engine`=Off;**)      

 13. Enter the following command at the prompt
     ```
    <copy>SET SESSION use_secondary_engine=ON;</copy>
    ```
 14. Query b -  Find top 10 companies selling the biggest amount of tickets for planes taking off from US airports.	Run Pricing Summary Report Query:

    ```
