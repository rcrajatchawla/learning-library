# Using Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI to Predict Churn

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use the Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks and the OML4SQL interface provided with Autonomous Database, as well as the OML AutoML UI and its features to identify customers with a higher likelihood of churning from **Oracle MovieStream** streaming services to a different movie streaming company.

There are two parts to this Lab:
- Data preparation required by machine learning algorithms to understand customer behavior from the past
- Use of the Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI to build a model that can predict churn, and score current customers

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

## Task 1: Understanding customer churn and preparing the OML environment

To understand customer behavior, we need to look into their Geo-Demographic information, but also their transactional behavior. For transactional data, we need to summarize number of transactions and aggregate values per month for each type of transaction that we would like to explore. This is because the algorithms need to receive as input a single row per customer, with their attributes provided in database table columns.

To create the database table needed to build a machine learning model, we will work with the data that exists in the **CUSTSALES** Oracle Database table. This table contains historical customer transactions for every movie streamed, including payment and discounts, and can help us identify customer preferences and usage of the service. To aggregate the data, with **one customer per row** (which is a data layout required by Machine Learning), we will have to work with the **Date** information of the transactions to determine the customer behavior.

Defining what **customer churn** is can be very complex, but for our example here we will use the following definition:
- A customer will considered "churned" if they had **no (zero) streams in the last available month of data**, while having streamed movies during 12 months continuously before a **buffer** month (detailed below).
- In contrast to those customers, the customers that will be compared to those (and considered "non-churners") are the customers that have been **streaming movies for 12 months continuously as well as on the last available month of data**.

The following diagram shows the process we will use, including a **buffer** month that represents the time needed to be able to **act** on the knowledge that a customer is about to leave.  Predicting the **probability that a customer is going to leave exactly right now** does not help preparing a customer retention campaign, since there is a lot of processing involved in updating customer data at the end of a day before one can do scoring, excluding customers that have a **DO NOT CONTACT** exception, but also processing offers and other processes in sync with all other divisions of the enterprise will always take time.  

![Diagram of the Data on ML Churn Process](images/oml-customer-churn-concepts.png "Diagram of the Data on ML Churn Process")

In addition to that, **a customer churning today probably made that decision a while ago**, so our machine learning model needs to be able to detect any change in behavior from at least a month ago, which is the reason for the buffer of 1 month in the following process.

In **Task 2** we will learn how to create and run the functions necessary to transform the data into the required layout for running the Machine Learning algorithms successfully.  We will do that by accessing an OML notebook that will provide a step-by-step process that is going to create the Table needed as input to the next Task.

We will finish up in **Task 3** using **OML AutoML UI** to create a machine learning model that best identifies future churn, then generate the code to score the current customers for their probability to churn in the future.

1. Download the Oracle Machine Learning Notebook for this lab.

    The first step is to download the notebook to your machine and then import it into OML Notebooks.

    **Click** <a href="./files/Data_Preparation_for_Predicting_Churn_with_OML.json" download="Data_Preparation_for_Predicting_Churn_with_OML.json" target="\_blank">**here**</a> to download the sample notebook for this lab, Data\_Preparation\_for\_Predicting\_Churn\_with\_OML.json, to a folder on your local computer.

2. Access OML Notebook as one of the ADB users.

    You can import, create, and work with notebooks in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks. You can access Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks from Autonomous Database.

    In "Lab 2: Quick Tour of ADW", under "Task 1: Familiarizing with the Autonomous Database Console",  at the Step 6 you got access to the **Development page**.  In there you can see a "card" to open **Oracle Machine Learning (OML) Notebooks**.

    As a quick recap, from the tab on your browser with your ADW instance, click **Service Console**.

    ![Service Console](images/adw-moviestream-main-short.png "")

    Once in the Service Console, select **Development** from the menu on the left.

    ![Development tab in Service Console](images/adw-service-console-menu.png " ")

    From the cards that are available in the Development section, click on the **Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks** card.

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks option in Development tab in Oracle ADW](images/adw-service-console-oml-card.png " ")

    <if type="livelabs">Sign in with ``MOVIESTREAM`` using the password you created in "Lab 3: Create a Database User", Task 1, Step 5. </if><if type="freetier">Enter your Autonomous Database user credentials and click **Sign in**.<br>Please note that your user has to have the proper credentials for Oracle Machine Learning, described under "**Lab 3:** Create a Database User", at "**Task 2:** Update the User's Profile to Grant Additional Roles"</if>

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks Sign-in page](images/oml-login-page.png " ")

    Click on the **Notebooks** on the Quick Actions menu.

    ![Oracle Machine Learning home page](images/oml-notebooks-first-login.png " ")

3. Import the Notebook into your OML Notebooks session.

    In the Notebooks listing page, click the **Import** button and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the notebook **Data\_Preparation\_for\_Predicting\_Churn\_with\_OML.json** file you downloaded previously in Task 1.

    Click **Open** to load the notebook into your environment.

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks import](images/oml-notebooks-import.png " ")

    If the import succeeds, you will receive a notification at the top of the screen that the Import process worked, and you should be able to see the notebook called **Data Prep for Predicting Churn with OML** in the list of notebooks.

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks main menu](images/oml-notebooks-after-import.png " ")

    You are ready to proceed to the next Task.

4. Open the notebook just imported into OML Notebooks.

    We are going to open the notebook for editing. For that we need to **click on the notebook's name**. You will see that the notebook server starts and loads the notebook, where you get to the top of the Notebook.

    ![Churn Notebook first screen](images/oml-churn-note-first-screen.png " ")

5. Make sure the notebook has an **Interpreter** assigned.
 
   Before running anything on the notebook, we have to make adjustments to the **Interpreters**, which specify whether to run the notebook by default using the LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH Autonomous Database consumer group. You can read more about the details of the different service levels in the [Autonomous Database documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/service-names-data-warehouse.html#GUID-80E464A7-8ED4-45BB-A7D6-E201DD4107B7).

    The first thing we need to do is to **click on the gear icon on the top right**, which will open the panel with the Interpreters, and on that panel make sure to select at least one of the interpreters that indicate **%sql (default), %script, %python**.  You can move the interpreters to change their order and bring the one you prefer to the top.  Ideally move the **MEDIUM** interpreter (the one with "_medium" in the name) to the top, or only select it by clicking on it (it becomes blue) and leave the others unclicked (they stay white).

    ![Churn Notebook interpreter screen](images/oml-churn-note-first-screen-interpreters.png " ")

    Once you are satisfied, **click Save** to save your options, and stay in the notebook screen.

7. Run the entire notebook.

   We will follow the notes and instructions in the notebook, but before we do, and to make sure the entire environment is ready, we will run the entire notebook by clicking at the top of the screen, on the icon that looks like a **play button** next to the notebook name, like indicated in the image below.

    ![Churn Notebook Run All option](images/oml-churn-note-step1-runall.png " ")

    In the menu that pops open, confirm that you do want to run the entire Notebook by clicking the **OK** button.

    The entire run is expected to take around 5 minutes or less, depending on the resources available, but we can start exploring the contents while it is still running.

## Task 2: Data Preparation for Machine Learning

1. Prepare a time difference column to build our monthly aggregations

    The `CUSTSALES` database table contains a time stamp column called `DAY_ID` indicating when each purchase was made.  To identify customer trends over time, we will build new aggregation columns that indicate how many months before the last one were the transactions made.  This is because machine learning algorithms do not know the meaning of January or September, and because we are going to be always evaluating the last X months of data before predicting the customer behavior in the subsequent months, so we will want relative numbers.

    On other types of machine learning problems, one could include seasonality into the mix, including seasons of the year, week of the month, day of the week and more, but in our current example we will simplify the process and only look at monthly trends.

    You can follow on the notebook and keep scrolling down as you go through it.  You see that the current explains the data aggregation we need, so we will start by checking out the data.  

    ![Churn Notebook Step 1 screen](images/oml-churn-note-step1-screen.png " ")

    Scrolling down you will see the first steps, where we counted the number of records from the `CUSTOMER` dataset, and the `CUSTSALES` table.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 1 count customers](images/oml-churn-note-step1-count-customers.png " ")

    We also wanted to investigate the distributions of some of the columns.  Usually it would be important to look at all the columns, but we give you an example here.  We are looking for any irregularities in the distributions.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 1 histograms](images/oml-churn-note-step1-histograms.png " ")

    We finally reviewed a listing of the `CUSTSALES` table.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 1 custsales table](images/oml-churn-note-step1-custsales.png " ")

    We prepared a time difference column `MDIFF_JAN2021`, so we created the aggregations by the difference of time to a specific month.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 1 time difference intro](images/oml-churn-note-step1-timedif-intro.png " ")

    We ran a quick test to check if everything is as expected in our assumption for the calculation, and checked the time difference distribution, which we expected would be in a range from 1 (latest month) to 24 (2 years ago).

2. Prepare some acceleration and velocity attributes to try to understand customer behavior.

    In this step we used the time difference column we created to build the aggregation attributes for the `CUSTSALES` table.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 introduction to acceleration attributes](images/oml-churn-note-step2-accel-intro.png " ")

    To make sure that the aggregate number of transactions per month is working correctly, we limited the query to a single customer that we know had transactions for all months, and compared to a customer that we know did not make any transactions in the last month (considered a **churner**).  We expect that the **non-churner** customer on the left would have transactions on `MDIFF_JAN2021=1`, while the **churner** would only start to have transactions on `MDIFF_JAN2021=2`.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 acceleration aggregations](images/oml-churn-note-step2-accel-agg.png " ")

    Since this works, we created the full Pivot for the aggregations for each customer.  Machine learning models require data to be all consolidated in a single record for each `CUST_ID`, so we needed to use some pivot processing on the data.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 acceleration pivot prep](images/oml-churn-note-step2-accel-pivot-prep.png " ")

    We created the full code for testing with only those 2 customers we had previously experimented with, just to check for any problems.  It starts with the many `CASE` statements in the code, where we are identifying which month the transaction is coming from and accumulating the results.

    The query starts with:
    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 test query 1](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-test-query1.png " ")

    The query ends with:

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 test query 2](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-test-query2.png " ")

    The result can be seen in those 2 records listed, where we can see that the **churner** has an expected **"0"** for the data from **M1**.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 Pivot Test Output](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-test-out.png " ")

    We notice that the mechanics work, so next we created a view on top of the entire `CUSTSALES` table to continue with the creation of the acceleration and velocity attributes.

    All we did was to add a CREATE VIEW statement, giving the view a name of `SALES_SUMMARY`, and we also removed the WHERE clause that was limiting the previous query to 2 customers.  The beginning of the query looks like:

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 Pivot Create View](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-create-view.png " ")

    With the `SALES_SUMMARY` view created, we added new attributes related to the trends and acceleration that a customer might have over time. For that, we created new attributes based on the existing ones into a new view, called `TRENDS_SALES_TRANS`.

    Below we show the code that created a new view containing (for each `CUST_ID` found in the `SALES_SUMMARY`) additional columns that are transformations on the existing aggregated monthly columns. We then previewed the output.

    You will note that there are plain averages being calculated, but also that we computed **ratios**. An example of the calculation of averages is provided in the code is below.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 Pivot Additional Attributes](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-add-attr.png " ")

    To calculate the ratios, it is important to make sure the denominator of the division is not "0", so we used a CASE statement to verify and avoid this condition, as shown here.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 2 Pivot Additional Ratios](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-add-ratios.png " ")

    We then prefiewed the data in our `TRENDS_SALES_TRANS` view. Remember to scroll to the right to check most of the new attributes created.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 1 time difference statistics](images/oml-churn-note-step2-pivot-final-check.png " ")

3. Prepare a pivoting table for several of the transaction features.

    We then explored the different categorical columns that we can use for pivoting.  

    ![Churn Notebook Step 3 Intro](images/oml-churn-note-step3-intro.png " ")

    For example, let's take a look at the **25 most popular Movies**, and also check **all the different genres**.  To help identify the movies by name, we merged our `CUSTSALES` table with the `MOVIE` table.  We also did the same with the `GENRE` table when identifying the different names of genres.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 3 check Movies](images/oml-churn-note-step3-check-movies.png " ")

    We created a **pivoting map** for each categorical attribute available in the `CUSTSALES` table, so that we can understand how many movies the customers watched in the different devices or browser types, what type of payment methods they prefer, different times they watched the popular movies or how many movies of each genre they like.  This gives us a good insight into customer behavior.

    We stored that information into a new view called `CUSTOMER_CATEGORIES`.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 3 Create Customer Categories](images/oml-churn-note-step3-create-cat.png " ")

     We previewed the `CUSTOMER_CATEGORIES` view and all the new columns created per customer.  Remember to scroll right to see all the additional columns in the visualization.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 3 Final check](images/oml-churn-note-step3-final-check.png " ")


4. Prepare a column that will represent whether a customer has churned (1) or not(0) in the last available month

    We created the **target** column based on the assumption that for the Business Manager, if a customer did not have any interaction in the last month of data, the customer is considered as **churned**.

    In that sense, we created a query that has a new attribute called **TARGET** that is defined as follows:
    ```
    For all customers that had transactions on every month between M3 and M14:
    TARGET = "1" -> "Churner" if the customer had no transactions in Month 1 (December 2020)
    TARGET = "0" -> "Non-Churner" otherwise
    ```

    That means that because of our requirement of existing transactions on all those months, customers that just started or that churned inside the M14 to M3 range will be excluded, so that our model can concentrate on identifying **churner** vs. **non-churner** behavior in that same historical subset of time.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 4 Intro](images/oml-churn-note-step4-intro.png " ")

    We checked the number of customers that fit this definitions, and checked the number of **churners**.  We expect a proportion of **TARGET=1** (**churners**) of around 1.15% in our example.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 4 check churners](images/oml-churn-note-step4-check-churners.png " ")


5. Build the final dataset for Machine Learning.

We built a table called `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` which joined all the different components we worked on so far:
- The `CUSTOMER` table that contains the Geo-Demographics on the customers
- The `TRENDS_SALES_TRANS` pivoted view with trends, velocity and acceleration attributes
- The `CUSTOMER_CATEGORIES` pivoted view and the information on all those categorical attributes
- The churn definition as the `TARGET` attribute

    ![Churn Notebook Step 5 Intro](images/oml-churn-note-step5-intro.png " ")

    The beginning of the query is here:

    ![Churn Notebook Step 5 final query](images/oml-churn-note-step5-final-query.png " ")

    The final check for the number of existing **churners** vs. **non-churners** is at the bottom of the notebook.

    ![Churn Notebook Step 5 final check](images/oml-churn-note-step5-final-check.png " ")

## Task 3: Use AutoML UI to Build a Machine Learning Model to Predict Churn

In this task, you will use the Oracle Machine Learning (OML) AutoML UI provided with your Autonomous Database and its features to identify customers with a higher likelihood of churning from **Oracle MovieStream** streaming services to a different movie streaming company.

We have prepared the final table called `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` in the previous tasks, so now we can use it in our analysis.

1. Open the OML AutoML UI interface from the main OML menu and create an **Experiment**.

    If you have closed or have signed out of your OML Notebooks session, follow the instructions on **Task 1**, **Step 2** to get to the home screen of OML Notebooks like the one below, and click on "AutoML".

    ![Churn AutoML Step 1 home menu](images/oml-churn-automl-home-menu.png " ")

    You should see the OML AutoML UI Experiments menu, which should be empty. Let's create a **new experiment** by clicking the **Create** button indicated below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 1 main menu](images/oml-churn-automl-main-menu.png " ")

    We need to give the new experiment a **name**, and optionally a description in the **comments** section. Type the name you would like to call it by and a description if you wish.  

    Then, click on the **magnifying glass icon** at the right of the **Data Source** field, so that we can find the table called `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` that we have just created.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 1 open data source](images/oml-churn-automl-open-data.png " ")

    In the **Select Table** menu that opens, leave the `SCHEMA` selection as it is, and on the right side scroll down to search for the `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` table. Alternatively, you can start typing `CHURN` in the search box at the bottom of the list, and it should appear. Select the `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` table and click on the **OK** button.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 1 select data source](images/oml-churn-automl-select-data.png " ")

    Back on the **Experiment** page, the **Data Source** name is populated with our selection, and OML AutoML UI will display several statistics for each attribute of the table.

    Scroll down in the **Experiment** page until you see the **Features** section. A list of the attributes available in the table is displayed. Please note that there is a **scroll bar** for the list itself at the right, next to the **Std Dev** statistic.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 1 features list](images/oml-churn-automl-features-list.png " ")

2. Define the Prediction Target, Case ID and Experiment Settings.

    Back to the top of the **Experiments** page, at the right of the screen you will find two pull-down menus.  We need to use those to define what we want to predict, in the **Predict** field. Click on the down-arrow and search for `TARGET`. Alternatively you can start typing in the `Search` box that appears.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 target search](images/oml-churn-automl-target-search.png " ")

    Repeat the process with the **Case ID** pull-down menu selection, identifying the column `CUST_ID` as the unique identifier of our customer. The final result should look like the image below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 target selection](images/oml-churn-automl-target-selection.png " ")

    On the left hand side, just under the **Data Source**, you should have noted that now the **Prediction Type** pull-down option is showing **Classification**. This is because OML AutoML UI detects that our recently selected **Predict** column, our `TARGET` attribute, has only two distinct values and as such this is a binary classification problem. The other option is **Regression**, which is not appropriate for our problem, so we just leave it as is.

    Below that we find the **Additional Settings** section.  Let's expand that by clicking on the little triangle next to its name. In here you see that the default values for **Maximum Top Models** is **5**, but we will reduce that to **2** to make it a bit faster for this workshop. Also, we will increase the **Database Service Level** to Medium. Increasing it to **High** might cause other queries to the same database to be de-prioritized, so you might want to be careful with that. Read more about Service Levels with OML AutoML UI in [this Blog Post](https://blogs.oracle.com/machinelearning/oml-automl-ui-4-things-you-can-do-that-affect-performance).

    We are going to leave the **Algorithms** selections as is, which means that OML AutoML UI will try each of these algorithms to find the best one for us.

    Here's what our selections look like.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 additional settings](images/oml-churn-automl-additional-settings.png " ")

    We are now ready to start the Experiment

3. Run the Experiment and explore the results.

    At the very top right of the screen, you will find the **Start** button. We will click on it, and from the sub-menu that appears, we will select **Faster Results**. With that selection, OML AutoML UI will search for models on a reduced hyperparameter search space, to speed up the process.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 start experiment](images/oml-churn-automl-start-experiment.png " ")

    As a reference point, we expect this **Experiment** to run to completion on a **Classification** task using **Balanced Accuracy** as the metric, and using **Maximum Top Models of 2** in about **15 minutes or less**.

    **IMPORTANT:** Please note that if you choose different settings for your own Experiment, a larger number if models, or even run it at **Best Accuracy** instead of **Faster Results**, a longer running time might be reguired, and a different "best" algorithm might be chosen.  In that case, your results might differ slightly from the screens below, but will still be valid and correct. 

    While the **Experiment** is running, you will note that there are **three dots** under a progress bar at the top right.

    By clicking on the **three dots** themselves, a full floating **Progress** indicator opens, showing the specific step of the process the **Experiment** is currently running.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 open progress](images/oml-churn-automl-open-progress.png " ")

    This process is completely **asynchronous**, so you can go back to the **Experiments** menu at any time by clicking on the blue button on the top left.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 back to Experiments](images/oml-churn-automl-back-to-experiments.png " ")

    You can see then that the **Experiments** listing shows our experiment as **running**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 Experiments status](images/oml-churn-automl-experiment-status.png " ")

    Clicking on the **Experiment Name** (Churn Prediction Model in our case) takes us back to the running screen.

    The performance of OML AutoML UI depends a lot of the type of environment your Autonomous Database is running on. As explained in [this blog post](https://blogs.oracle.com/machinelearning/oml-automl-ui-4-things-you-can-do-that-affect-performance), several components may affect the performance, among the most important ones is the number of CPUs that can be allocated to your Autonomous Database instance, and whether you can enable auto-scaling on Autonomous Database.  

    Once the process completes, you will note that the **running icon** on the top right changes to indicate it is **Completed**. The **Balanced Accuracy** chart will show the increased accuracy over time as the models were tested, and the **Leader Board** will present the different algorithms that were chosen, and their respective **Model Names**.

    In the following screen we can see that the top 2 algorithms chosen were **Random Forest** and a **Decision Tree**. By default they receive randomly generated unique **Model Names**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 completed experiment](images/oml-churn-automl-completed-experiment.png " ")

    After an **Experiment** run is completed, the **Features** grid displays an additional column **Importance**. This feature importance indicates the overall level of sensitivity of prediction to a particular feature. Hover your cursor over the graph to view the value of importance. The value is always depicted in the range 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 being more important.

    Please Note: this importance value is **not** related to any particular model, but it shows an overall value to give us an idea of potentially which attributes would be important.

    Scroll down to see the **Features** section. You will also note a **Search** box at the top right of this section, which is important given that there are 170+ attributes.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 Features importance](images/oml-churn-automl-features-importance.png " ")

    In this **Experiment**, the attributes with the highest **overall importance** are:
    ```
    AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION, AVG_NTRANS_M3_11, AVG_DISC_M12_14, APP_CHROME, HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, APP_MOBILE, GENRE_ROMANCE and AVG_NTRANS_M3_14
    ```

    Scrolling up to the **Leader Board** section, we can click on the **Random Forest** unique model name to open the diagnostics. Click on the Random Forest **Model Name** link in blue. The exact name will be unique to your model, and in the following example it is called *rf_d4d2503940*.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 Leader Board select model](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-model.png " ")

    The first screen that shows up is the **Prediction Impacts**. This time the attributes are listed in order of impact that this specific model uses in its formulation to predict churn.

    It includes the following geo-demographic attributes:

    ```

    From the customer product behavior point of view, it includes averages of transactions from the last Quarter (M3\_5) and the last 6 months (M3\_8), as well as the number of transactions using different devices, types of payment and specific genres of movies watched.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 Prediction Impacts](images/oml-churn-automl-prediction-impacts.png " ")

    After reviewing the impacts, click on the **Confusion Matrix** tab to visualize the result of the assessment of the model on a **Test Set** of data chosen by AutoML for this test.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 Confusion Matrix](images/oml-churn-automl-confusion-matrix.png " ")

    In the **Confusion Matrix** we can see that, in this particular **Test Set**,  there were 1,278 customers that were **predicted** to be **non-churners**, and they actually were, so our model was correct.  

    There were **no** customers that were **predicted** to be **non-churners** when they were **churners**, which is good.

    On the column on the right, the model **predicted** incorrectly that 88 customers were going to be **churners** when they were not, but this kind of error is not that bad for marketing purposes, since we would be sending offers to these customers when they might be staying anyway.

    In the bottom right cell the model **predicted** 12 customers were going to **churn** when they actually did, and the model was able to capture all **churners** from this **Test Set**.

4. View other metrics of model quality

    Back in the **Leader Board** section, there are many actions that can be done at this point with a model.

    We will first check out the **Metrics** menu option, by **clicking on it**.  A menu will pop open showing several metrics that can be selected. Choose a few ones and just close the menu in the top right **X** when ready.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board select metrics](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-metrics.png " ")

    The new metrics will be displayed for each model and would allow you to compare and sort the list of models by each type of metric as desired.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board view metrics](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-more-metrics.png " ")

5. Deploy the model to OML Services REST APIs
   
    Clicking on the **row of a model**, but not on the model name itself, would highlight that row **in a blue hue**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board selection](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-selection.png " ")

    You will now be able to select any of the three menus under **Leader Board**, with the options to *Deploy*, *Rename* and *Create Notebook*.

    You have the option to **Deploy** a model, which would allow you to register the model with Oracle Machine Learning Services. OML Services enable sub-second scoring from a REST interface that is suitable for real-time applications.

    An example of the Deployment dialog window is shown below, and it is optional for this **Workshop**.

    More details on the [OML AutlML UI model deployment documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml-automl-ui/amlui/deploy.html). 
    For more information on Oracle Machine Learning Services, see [OML Services documentation on model deployment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/omlss/omlss/use-case-oml.html).

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board deploy model](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-deploy.png " ")

    You can fill in the information required as follows:
    - In the Name field, the system generated model name is displayed here by default. You can edit this name. The model name must be a unique alphanumeric name (no spaces, '_' as special character is preferred) with maximum 50 characters.
    - In the URI field, enter a name for the model URI. The URI must be alphanumeric (no spaces, '_' as special character is preferred), and the length must be max 200 characters.
    - In the Version field, enter a version of the model. The version must be in the format xx.xx where x is a number.
    - In the Namespace field, enter a name for the model namespace. Usually `OML_MODELS` would indicate an in-Database model.
    - Click **Shared** to allow users with access to the database schema to view and deploy the model.
    
    In the case of a successful deployment, a notice at the top of the screen will indicate that, as shown below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board deploy model successful](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-deploy-message.png " ")   

6. Create an auto-generated notebook with the model selected in the Leaderboard
 
    The next option available is the **Create Notebook** button, which generates a Python-based notebook using the Oracle Machine Learning for Python interface. This notebook will contain the hyperparameters selected by the AutoML process and allows you to create the model explicitly using OML4Py.

    While still making sure the best model is selected (row highlighted in a blue hue), click on the **Create Notebook** button to open a dialog window where you specify the name you want for this notebook. This step is also optional for this **Workshop**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board Create Notebook](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-notebook.png " ")   

    Upon successful **Notebook** creation, a notice at the top of the screen will indicate that, as shown below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board Create Notebook message](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-notebook-message.png " ")  

    If you were to open the Notebook from the **OML Notebooks** menu, you would see that the entire code for building the exact model you have chosen is there,  written in Python using OML4Py capabilities, so that a Data Scientist can study and modify the model at their will, as well as do batch scoring. 

7. Rename the model in preparation for Scoring via SQL
   
    Finally, there is an option to **Rename** the model, which **we will need to do** in order to continue with the scoring later. Click on the **Rename** button and give your model a name.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board Rename model](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-rename.png " ")  

    If the Rename is successful, a notice at the top of the screen will indicate that, as shown below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board Rename message](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-rename-message.png " ")  

    It will also show up in the **Leader Board** with the new name as well.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 4 Leader Board Rename new name](images/oml-churn-automl-leader-rename-new-name.png " ")

    Now we are ready for scoring customers using SQL.

8. Score the customers using the AutoML model.

    With the model renamed to an easily recognizable name, you can now proceed to run a simple SQL query for creating a new table that will contain the list of customers with their **probabilities to churn**.

    Let's download a new **Oracle Machine Learning notebook** that has the code for scoring the table, and then import it into OML Notebooks.

    **Click** <a href="./files/Scoring_customers_with_Churn_Model.json" download="Scoring_customers_with_Churn_Model.json" target="\_blank">**here**</a> to download the sample Scoring notebook for this lab, "Scoring\_customers\_with\_Churn\_Model.json", to a folder on your local computer.

    Navigate back to the OML Notebooks screen, click the **Import** button and navigate to the folder where you just downloaded the notebook **Scoring\_customers\_with\_Churn\_Model.json** file.

    Click **Open** to load the notebook into your environment, like shown below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook import](images/oml-churn-automl-scoring-import-note.png " ")

    In case of success, you should receive a notification at the top of the screen that the import process was successful, and you should be able to see a new notebook called **Scoring customers with Churn Model** in the list of Notebooks.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook main menu](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-listing.png "Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook main menu")

    We are going to open the Notebook for editing.  For that we need to **click on the "Scoring customers with Churn Model" name**. You will see that the notebook server starts and loads the notebook. You should see the beginning of the notebook, as shown below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook first screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-screen1.png " ")

    Just as we did before, we have to make adjustments to the **Interpreters**, which specifies whether to run the notebook using the LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH Autonomous Database consumer group.

    The first thing we need to do is to click on the gear icon on the top right, which will open the panel with the Interpreters, and on that panel make sure to select at least one of the interpreters that indicate **%sql (default), %script, %python**. You can move the interpreters to change their order and bring the one you prefer to the top. Ideally move the **MEDIUM** interpreter (the one with "_medium" in the name) to the top, or only select it by clicking on it (it becomes blue) and leave the others unclicked (they stay white).

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook interpreter screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-interpreters.png " ")

    Once you are satisfied, **click Save** to save your options, and stay in the notebook screen.

    We will follow the notes and instructions in the notebook, but before we do, and to make sure the entire environment is ready, we will run the entire notebook by clicking at the top of the screen, on the icon that looks like a **play button** next to the notebook name, like indicated in the image below.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook Run All option](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-runall.png " ")

    In the menu that pops open, confirm that you do want to run the entire Notebook by clicking the **OK** button.

    The entire run is expected to take around 15 seconds, depending on the resources available.

    If we scroll down, we see basically two main steps.  The first paragraph deletes a table named `POTENTIAL_CHURNERS` if it exists, and the second paragraph uses SQL to create a new table based on the `PREDICTION` and `PREDICTION_PROBABILITY` capabilities by OML.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook second screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-screen2.png " ")

    Please note that the following code can be accessed by any Application through `JDBC` against this Autonomous Database instance, and the scoring will be returned.

    Also remember that you need to change the name of the model being used from `CHURN_PREDICTION_AUTOML_RF` to something else if you decided to use a different name when you were doing the model **Rename** in **Step 4** of **Task 3**.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM
      (SELECT CUST_ID,
              PREDICTION(CHURN_PREDICTION_AUTOML_RF USING M.*) WILL_CHURN,
              ROUND(PREDICTION_PROBABILITY(CHURN_PREDICTION_AUTOML_RF, '1'  USING M.*),6) PROB_CHURN
              FROM MOVIESTREAM_CHURN M)
    ORDER BY PROB_CHURN DESC;
    ```

  At the end, the following result is expected from the table of scores just created.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 5 Scoring Notebook third screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-screen3.png " ")

**CONGRATULATIONS!!!**

You now have deployed a new table called `POTENTIAL_CHURNERS` containing each customer's likelihood to churn and the decision (will the customer churn or not?) suggested by the Model.

Now other professionals can take advantage of both the deployment you have just made in order to contact the customers at risk with an offer, as well as use your SQL Scoring code to put the model into production and run the scoring in batch every time there is a new refresh of the data, be it hourly, daily, weekly or monthly.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
