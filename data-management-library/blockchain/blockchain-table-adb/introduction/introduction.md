# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will provision a Autonomous Database instance, manage blockchain tables and rows in a blockchain table. Later, work with signatures in blockchain table in the database. Then import a simple web application using Application Express (APEX) to see how to manage the rows, verify the rows and work with Signatures for Blockchain Table from a compute instance.

Estimated Time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
