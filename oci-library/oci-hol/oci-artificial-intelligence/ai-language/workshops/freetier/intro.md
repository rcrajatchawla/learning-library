# OCI Language

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a number of Software Development Kits (SDKs) to facilitate development of custom solutions. SDKs allow you to build and deploy apps that integrate with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Each SDK also includes tools and artifacts you need to develop an app, such as code samples and documentation. In addition, if you want to contribute to the development of the SDKs, they are all open source and available on GitHub.

You can invoke OCI Language capabilities through the OCI SDKs. In this lab session, we will show several code snippets to access OCI Language through the OCI SDKs. You do not need to execute the snippets, but review them to understand what information and steps are needed to implement your own integration. In addition, you can find OCI Language samples in different programming languages in this [github](https://github.com/oracle/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/master/ai_services/language) repository.

The Language service contains these pretrained language processing capabilities:

### 1. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
Identifies aspects from the given text and classifies each into positive, negative, or neutral polarity.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition
Identifies common entities, people, places, locations, email, and so on.

### 3. Key Phrase Extraction
Identify the most salient talking points in your text.

### 4. Language Detection
Detects languages based on the given text, and includes a confidence score.

### 5. Text Classification
Identifies the document category and subcategory that the text belongs to.

Explore the Language service within the Oracle Cloud AI service group to perform NLP tasks like detecting languages, extracting key elements, classifying intent, detecting the sentiment, etc., in the text with a few simple steps.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 1 hour

### Objectives:

* Understand a high level overview of the OCI Language
* Understand the full cycle/workflow of services provided in the OCI Language
* Learn to use REST API to interact with OCI Language
* Learn to use CLI to interact with OCI Language
* Learn to use the OCI Language SDKs.
* Learn to access OCI Language in DataScience NotebookSession
<!-- * Learn to access OCI Language Service in Data Flow. -->

### Prerequisites:
* An Oracle Free Tier, or Paid Cloud Account
* Additional prerequisites (cloud services) are mentioned per lab
* Familiar with OCI Policy and SDK/CLI setup.
* Familiar with Python/Java programming for SDK usage is strongly recommended.
* Familiar with OCI services like DataScience, DataFlow etc., are recommended, but not required.
* Familiar with editing tools (vim, nano) or shell environments (cmd, bash, etc) (Optional for API integration)
