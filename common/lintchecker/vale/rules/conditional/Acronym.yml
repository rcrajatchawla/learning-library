  # Rule Overview

  `conditional` ensures that the existence of `first` implies the
  existence of `second`. For example, consider the following text:

  > According to Wikipedia, the World Health Organization (WHO) is a
  > specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with
  > international public health. We can now use WHO because it has been
  > defined, but we can't use DAFB because people may not know what it
  > represents. We can use DAFB when it's presented as code, though.

ignorecase: false
# Ensures that the existence of 'first' implies the existence of 'second'.
first: '\b([A-Z]{3,5})\b'
second: '(?:\b[A-Z][a-z]+ )+\(([A-Z]{3,5})\)'
