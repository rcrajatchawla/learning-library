  # Rule Overview

  `readability` calculates a readability score according the specified metrics.
  The supported tests are 'Gunning Fog', 'Coleman-Liau', 'Flesch-Kincaid',
  'SMOG', and 'Automated Readability'.

  If more than one is listed (as seen above), the scores will be averaged. This
  is also the only extension point that doesn't accept a scope, as readability
  is always calculated using the entire document (minus headings, code blocks,
  and lists).

  `grade` is the highest acceptable score. Using the example above, a warning
  will be issued if grade exceeds 8.

level: warning
grade: 8
