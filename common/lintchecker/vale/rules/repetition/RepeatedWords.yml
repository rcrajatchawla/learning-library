  # Rule Overview

  This rule looks for repeated instances of 'words' (as defined by the
  the `tokens` regex).

  Thanks to Vale's internal processing of markup, it's able to detect
  this in cases that plain regex could not -- such as within Markdown
  links:

  This was [added to the API in](example.com) in v2.4.0.

# Actions are a Vale Server feature (https://errata.ai/vale-server/)
# that adds the allows its integrations (such as VS Code) to one-click
# fixes to rules.
action:
  name: edit
  params:
