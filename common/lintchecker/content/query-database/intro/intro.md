# Introduction:

## Getting Started with Oracle Autonomous Database

Oracle Autonomous Database is is a family of self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing cloud services. It's the world's first autonomous database, and it redefines database management by using machine learning and automation to eliminate human labor, human error, and manual tuning, reducing cost and complexity and ensuring higher reliability, security, and more operational efficiency. Oracle Autonomous Database supports a complex mix of high-performance transactions, including reporting, drag and drop, batch, Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning in a single database. This simplifies application development and deployment and enables real-time analytics, personalization, and fraud detection.

Once you provision your database, you can load data into it using Oracle database migration and 3rd party data integration and tools.

Migration is the process of copying the schema objects and data from a source MySql to Autonomous Database. Using Oracle SQL Developer Migration Wizard you can perform migration in an efficient and largely automated way.
