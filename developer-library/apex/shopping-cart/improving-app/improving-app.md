# Improve the App

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to enable some pages to be viewed by any user who accesses the app. 

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Set the following pages as public pages:
    - Products
    - Shopping Cart
    - Order Information
- Disable the Navigation Menu
- Enhance the Navigation Bar

## Task 1: Set Pages to be Public
Your customers don't need to login the app in order to shop the products, so let's set the following pages as public:
- Page  1: Products
- Page 16: Order Information
- Page 17: Shopping Cart
- Page 18: Add to Cart

Follow these Tasks for the four listed pages:

1. From the runtime application, navigate to the page.

    In the Developer Toolbar click **Edit Page x**.

2. Within Page Designer, in the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to  **Page x: Name of the Page**.

    In the Property Editor (right pane), apply the following change:
    - Under Security section:
        - For Authentication - select **Page Is Public**

3. Click **Save**.

4. Navigate to Page Finder and go to the next page.

## Task 2: Cleaning the Navigation Menu
Since the home page is the Products page and this is a public access page as some others too, it's not needed to have a navigation menu. 
In this Task, you will turn off displaying the navigation menu.

1. Within Page Designer, click on the Shared Components icon at the top right.
