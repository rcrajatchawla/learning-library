# Sign up for an Oracle APEX Workspace

## Introduction

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) services. To start, you will need to decide which Oracle Database you are going to use for the lab, and then create an APEX workspace in that database.

If you already have an APEX 21.1 Workspace provisioned you can skip this lab and go straight to (Lab 1) [Installing Sample Tables](?lab=1-installing-sample-tables)

### What is an APEX Workspace?
An APEX Workspace is a logical domain where you define APEX applications. Each workspace is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which are used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and more. These database objects are generally what APEX applications are built on top of.
