# Oracle Database CI/CD for Developers - Lab 2: Create an Autonomous Database

## Introduction

In this lab you will start by creating a compartment in OCI. Once the compartment is created, you will then create an Autonomous Database in that compartment.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

- Create a Compartment
- Create an Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

- You have completed [Lab 1, Clone and Create a Github Repository](../repo/repo.md).

## Task 1: Create a Compartment

We are going to create a **Compartment** for this lab so that our database is in a specific compartment for this LiveLab and can also be easily found and used for additional LiveLabs.

1. To create a compartment, use the OCI web console drop down menu and select **Identity & Security**, then **Compartments**.

2. On the Compartments page, click the **Create Compartment** button.

3. Using the **Create Compartment** modal, set the following values:

    **Name:** livelabs

    ````
    <copy>
    livelabs
    </copy>
    ````

    ![Create Compartment Name Field](./images/comp-3.png)

    **Description:** livelabs

    ````
    <copy>
    livelabs
    </copy>
    ````
    ![Create Compartment Name Field](./images/comp-4.png)

    **Parent Compartment:** Use the root compartment (Should be auto-selected, your root compartment will be named different, but will have (root) after it)

    ![Create Compartment Parent Compartment Field](./images/comp-5.png)

4. When your Create Compartment modal looks like the following image (root compartment name will be different but have (root) after the name), click the **Create Compartment** button.

## Task 2: Create an Autonomous Database

1. Use the OCI web console drop down menu to go to **Oracle Database** and then **Autonomous Database**.

    ![ADB from the menu](./images/adb-1.png)

2. On the Autonomous Database page, change your compartment to the livelabs compartment using the **Compartment** dropdown on the left side of the page.

3. With the livelabs compartment selected, click the **Create Autonomous Database** button on the top of the page.

4. In the **Create Autonomous Database** page, we start in the **Provide basic information for the Autonomous Database** section. Here we can ensure our **Compartment** is **livelabs** and give our database a **Display Name**. We can use **ORDS ADB** as the Display Name.

    **Display Name:** ORDS ADB

    ````
    <copy>
    ORDS ADB
    </copy>
    ````
    ![Display Name Field](./images/adb-4.png)

    For the **Database Name**, we can use **ORDSADB**.

      **Database Name:** ORDSADB

    ````
    <copy>
    ORDSADB
    </copy>
    ````
    ![Display Name Field](./images/adb-5.png)  

    The **Provide basic information for the Autonomous Database** section should look like the following image:

   ![Provide basic information for the Autonomous Database section](./images/adb-6.png)  

5. For Database **Workload Type**, choose **Transaction Processing**.

   ![Database Workload](./images/adb-7.png)  

6. In the **Deployment Type** section, choose **Shared Infrastructure** if not already selected for you.

   ![Deployment Type](./images/adb-8.png)  

7. Next we have the **Configure the database** section. Start here by clicking the **Always Free** toggle button so that it is switched to the right side as seen in the following image.

   ![Always Free toggle button](./images/adb-9.png)  

8. Use the **Choose database version** dropdown to choose **21c** as the database version.

   ![Choose database version dropdown](./images/adb-10.png)

9. Your **Configure the database** section should look like the following image.

   ![Complete Configure the database section](./images/adb-11.png)

10. The next section is **Create administrator credentials**. Here, provide a password that conforms to the password complexity rules of:

    ```
    Password must be 12 to 30 characters and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
    The password cannot contain the double quote (") character or the username "admin".
    ```

    If the password does conform to these rules and matches in both fields, the section should look like the following image.

   ![admin password section](./images/adb-12.png)

11. For the **Choose network access** section, select **Secure access from everywhere** if not already selected. Leave the **Configure access control rules** checkbox unchecked.

   ![admin password section](./images/adb-13.png)

12. The **Choose a license type** section should default to **License Included**.

   ![Choose a license type section](./images/adb-14.png)

13. When the **Create Autonomous Database** is completely filled out, click the **Create Autonomous Database** button on the bottom left of the page.

14. Your Autonomous Database should be done creating in just a few short minutes. 


## Conclusion

In this lab you created a Compartment and an Autonomous Database.
