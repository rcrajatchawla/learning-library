# Install Verrazzano on a Kubernetes Cluster in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to install Verrazzano on a Kubernetes cluster in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

### About Product/Technology

Verrazzano is an end-to-end enterprise container platform for deploying cloud-native and traditional applications in multicloud and hybrid environments. It is made up of a curated set of open source components – many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces that make Verrazzano a cohesive and easy to use platform.

Verrazzano includes the following capabilities:

* Hybrid and multicluster workload management
* Special handling for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon applications
* Multicluster infrastructure management
* Integrated and pre-wired application monitoring
* Integrated security
* DevOps and GitOps enablement

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Open Cloud Shell and setup `kubectl` to use the Oracle Kubernetes Engine cluster
* Install the Verrazzano platform operator.
* Install the development (`dev`) profile of Verrazzano.

### Prerequisites

Verrazzano requires the following:

* A Kubernetes cluster and a compatible `kubectl`.
* At least 2 CPUs, 100GB disk storage, and 16GB RAM available on the Kubernetes worker nodes. This is sufficient to install the development profile of Verrazzano. Depending on the resource requirements of the applications you deploy, this may or may not be sufficient for deploying your applications.
* In Lab 1, you created a Kubernetes cluster on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You will use that Kubernetes cluster, *cluster1*, for installing the development profile of Verrazzano.

## Task 1: Configure `kubectl` (Kubernetes Cluster CLI)

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Cloud Shell is a web browser-based terminal, accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console. The Cloud Shell provides access to a Linux shell, with a pre-authenticated Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI and other useful tools (*Git, kubectl, helm, OCI CLI*) to complete the Verrazzano tutorials. The Cloud Shell is accessible from the Console. Your Cloud Shell will appear in the Oracle Cloud Console as a persistent frame of the Console, and will stay active as you navigate to different pages of the Console.

You will use the *Cloud Shell* to complete this workshop.

We will use `kubectl` to manage the cluster remotely using the Cloud Shell. It needs a `kubeconfig` file. This will be generated using the OCI CLI which is pre-authenticated, so there’s no setup to do before you can start using it.

1. Click **Access Cluster** on your cluster detail page.

    > If you moved away from that page, then open the navigation menu and under **Developer Services**, select **Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)**. Select your cluster and go the detail page.

    > A dialog is displayed from which you can open the Cloud Shell and contains the customized OCI command that you need to run, to create a Kubernetes configuration file.

2. Accept the default **Cloud Shell Access** and click **Copy** copy the `oci ce...` command to the Cloud Shell.

3. Click **Launch Cloud Shell** to open the built-in console. Close the configuration dialog before you paste the command into the Cloud Shell.

    ![Launch Cloud Shell](images/3.png)

4. Copy the command from the clipboard and paste it into the Cloud Shell and run the command.

    For example, the command looks like the following:

    ```bash
    oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig --cluster-id ocid1.cluster.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaaezwen..................zjwgm2tqnjvgc2dey3emnsd --file $HOME/.kube/config --region us-phoenix-1 --token-version 2.0.0
    ```

    ![kubectl config](images/4.png)

5. Verify that the `kubectl` is working by using the `get node` command. <br>
You may need to run this command several times until you see the output similar to the following.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl get node</copy>
    ```

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get node
    NAME          STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
    10.0.10.112   Ready    node    4m32s   v1.19.7
    10.0.10.200   Ready    node    4m32s   v1.19.7
    10.0.10.36    Ready    node    4m28s   v1.19.7
    ```

    > If you see the node's information, then the configuration was successful.

6. You can minimize and restore the terminal size at any time using the controls at the top right corner of the Cloud Shell.


7. Leave this *Cloud Shell* open; we will use it for further labs.

## Task 2: Install the Verrazzano Platform Operator

Verrazzano provides a platform [operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) to manage the life cycle of Verrazzano installations. You can install, uninstall, and update Verrazzano installations by updating the [Verrazzano custom resource](https://verrazzano.io/docs/reference/api/verrazzano/verrazzano/).

Before installing Verrazzano, we need to install the Verrazzano Platform Operator.

1. Copy the following command and paste it in the *Cloud Shell* to run it.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano/releases/download/v1.0.0/operator.yaml</copy>
    ```

    ![verrazzano operator](images/9.png)

    > This `operator.yaml` file contains information about the operator and the service accounts and custom resource definitions. By running this *kubectl apply* command, we are specifying whatever is in the `operator.yaml` file.
    > All deployments in Kubernetes happen in a namespace. When we deploy the Verrazzano Platform Operator, it happens in the namespace called "verrazzano-install".

2. To find out the deployment status for the Verrazzano Platform Operator, copy the following command and paste it in the *Cloud Shell*.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl -n verrazzano-install rollout status deployment/verrazzano-platform-operator</copy>
    ```

    ![rollout status](images/10.png)

    > Confirm that the operator pod associated with the Verrazzano Platform Operator is correctly defined and running. A Pod is a unit which runs containers / images and Pods belong to nodes.

3. To find out the pod status, copy and paste the following command in the *Cloud Shell*.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl -n verrazzano-install get pods</copy>
    ```

    ![running pod](images/11.png)

## Task 3: Install the Verrazzano Development Profile

An installation profile is a well-known configuration of Verrazzano settings that can be referenced by name, which can then be customized as needed.

Verrazzano supports the following installation profiles: development (`dev`), production (`prod`), and managed cluster (`managed-cluster`).

* The production profile, which is the default, provides a 3-node Elasticsearch and persistent storage for the Verrazzano Monitoring Instance (VMI).
* The development profile provides a single node Elasticsearch and no persistent storage for the VMI.
* The managed-cluster profile installs only managed cluster components of Verrazzano. To take full advantage of multicluster features, the managed cluster should be registered with an admin cluster.

To change profiles in any of the following commands, set the *VZ_PROFILE* environment variable to the name of the profile you want to install.

For a complete description of Verrazzano configuration options, see the [Verrazzano Custom Resource Definition](https://verrazzano.io/docs/reference/api/verrazzano/verrazzano/).

In this lab, we are going to install the *development profile of Verrazzano*, which has the following characteristics:

* It has a lightweight installation.
* It is for evaluation purposes.
* No persistence.
* Single-node Elasticsearch cluster topology.

The following image describes the Verrazzano components that are installed with each profile.

According to our DNS choice, we can use nip.io (wildcard DNS) or [Oracle OCI DNS](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DNS/Concepts/dnszonemanagement.htm). In this lab, we are going to install using nip.io (wildcard DNS).

>An ingress controller is something that helps provide access to Docker containers to the outside world (by providing an IP address). The ingress routes the IP address to different clusters.

1. Install using the nip.io DNS Method. Copy the following command and paste it in the *Cloud Shell* to install Verrazzano.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: install.verrazzano.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Verrazzano
    metadata:
      name: my-verrazzano
    spec:
      profile: ${VZ_PROFILE:-dev}
    EOF
    </copy>
    ```

    ![wait for installation to complete](images/13.png)

    > It takes around 15 to 20 minutes to complete the installation. To view the installation logs, go to the next commands.

2. To find out how the installation process is going, you can copy and paste the following command in the *Cloud Shell* to monitor the console log.

    ```bash
    <copy>kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pod -l job-name=verrazzano-install-my-verrazzano -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")</copy>
    ```

    > The console log contains information about all the steps performed by the platform operator for installing Verrazzano, the components being installed, and the URLs we can use for accessing them.

    ![view logs](images/15.png)

3. Leave the *Cloud Shell* open and let the installation running. Please continue with the next lab.
